As you start visualizing , you'll notice that the design was carefully thought to be made with the netflix's in app and web design, so this can bring the viewer a different experience 

I downloaded the XLXS file from Kaggle.com Source: https://www.kaggle.com/

I upload the file to Power BI Desktop, and transformed data applying the next steps:

1. Cleaned date formats to regional
2. Added new metrics
3. Changed number formats 
4. Created new type of dimension called "Duration"
5. Renamed some columns 
6. Created the Calendar table
7. Created relations in between my model (Calendar with released date)

Then I started writing my DAX formulas (feel free to check them out on the HTML file)


Last task was , my questions to ask

1. What is the tv shows and movies share in total netflix's platform?
2. What is the most common duration in movies?
3. Which is the best month to release content?
4. What's the most common rating in movies and tv shows?


Then i started creating this amazing dashboard that answered this simple questions


Hope you enjoy it!
